Create a class named 'HamFrying' for managing the frying process of ham.

Inside the class:
  - Declare public variables for inspector assignment: 'goodHamMaterial', 'friedHamMaterial', 'fryingSound'.
  - Declare private variables 'isFrying' and 'fryingTimer' to track frying status and time.

  Define a method called 'OnTriggerEnter' with a parameter 'other':
    - Check if the collider is the frying pan.
    - If true, stick the ham to the frying pan and set 'isFrying' to true.

  Define a method called 'Update':
    - Check if the ham is frying.
    - If true, increment the frying timer.
    - Check if frying time is more than 10 seconds:
      - Change material to fried ham.
      - Play frying sound.
      - Reset frying state.

  Define a method called 'PlayFryingSound':
    - Check if AudioSource is available.
    - If not, add an AudioSource component.
    - Play the frying sound.

End of the 'HamFrying' class.
