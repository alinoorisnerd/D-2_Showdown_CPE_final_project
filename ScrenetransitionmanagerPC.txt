Create a class named 'SceneTransitionManager' for managing scene transitions.

Inside the class:
  - Declare a public variable 'fadeScreen' of type 'FadeScreen' for handling screen fading effects.

  Define a method called 'GoToSceneAsync' with a parameter 'sceneIndex':
    - Start a coroutine called 'GoToSceneAsyncRoutine' with the specified scene index.

  Define a coroutine called 'GoToSceneAsyncRoutine' with a parameter 'sceneIndex':
    - Initiate a fade-out effect using 'fadeScreen.FadeOut()'.
    - Start loading the new scene asynchronously.
    - Prevent the scene from activating immediately.
    - Use a timer to wait for both the fade-out effect and the scene loading to complete.
    - Allow the scene to activate.

End of the 'SceneTransitionManager' class.
