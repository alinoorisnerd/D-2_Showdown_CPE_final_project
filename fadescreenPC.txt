Create a class named 'FadeScreen' for managing screen fading effects.

Inside the class:
  - Declare public variables for inspector assignment: 'fadeOnStart', 'fadeDuration', 'fadeColor'.
  - Declare a private variable 'rend' of type Renderer to handle rendering.
  
  Define a method called 'Start':
    - Get the Renderer component from the GameObject.
    - If 'fadeOnStart' is true, initiate the fade-in effect.

  Define a method called 'FadeIn':
    - Call the 'Fade' method with parameters 1 (alpha in) and 0 (alpha out).

  Define a method called 'FadeOut':
    - Call the 'Fade' method with parameters 0 (alpha in) and 1 (alpha out).

  Define a method called 'Fade' with parameters 'alphaIn' and 'alphaOut':
    - Start a coroutine called 'FadeRoutine' with the specified alpha values.

  Define a coroutine called 'FadeRoutine' with parameters 'alphaIn' and 'alphaOut':
    - Use a while loop to gradually update the material's alpha value over time.
    - Set the material's alpha value.
    - Update the timer.
    - Yield until the next frame.

End of the 'FadeScreen' class.
