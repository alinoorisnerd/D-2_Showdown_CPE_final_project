Create a class named 'ChangeCamera' that manages virtual cameras in a game.

Inside the class:
  - Declare a public variable called 'currentCamera' to keep track of the active virtual camera.

  Define a method called 'Start':
    - This method is automatically executed when the script begins.
    - During the start, increase the priority of the 'currentCamera' by 1. 
    - The priority is a value that determines which virtual camera is in control.

  Define a method called 'UpdateCamera' with a parameter named 'target':
    - This method allows us to update the active camera to a new target camera.
    - Decrease the priority of the current camera by 1, making it less dominant.
    - Set the 'currentCamera' to the provided 'target', indicating the new camera we want to use.
    - Increase the priority of the new 'currentCamera' by 1, making it the primary camera.

End of the 'ChangeCamera' class.
